It’s piece of the code who translates the

5 )
It has been developped to make a easier way to code

6 )
An interpreter reads a lign of the code, he
translates on machine code and send it to the 
processor. He does it lign by lign.

A compiler reads a lign of the code, he translates 
on machine code and when he translates all the code,
he send it to the processor.
